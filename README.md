# Reproducible Geoprocessing of Agricultural, Climate, and Land Use Data at Scale with R

This repository contains tools and resources to supplement my talk at [The Workshop in Environmental Economics and Data Science (TWEEDS)](https://tweeds.io/) in October 2020.

The slides for the talk are available [here](potter_tweeds2020.pdf).

### Setting up an RStudio AWS Cloud System

- TBD

### Data Access and Processing

- Climate via gridMet / MACA
- Land use via the cropland data layer
- Soil via gSSURGO
- Regridding
- Profiling and Benchmarking
- Error Reduction
- Workflow Management

### Additional Resources

- Software Carpentry's [Research Computing Lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- Data Carpentry's [Geospatial Lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#geospatial-curriculum)
